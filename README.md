# Can of Books

**Author**: Jordan Folk and Chloe Nott
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

## Getting Started

This front end works with a nodejs/express backend. Both need to be deployed in order to use.

## Architecture

Mongoose (nosql) is used to store data on the server. The front end requests information from the server in the form of an api request.

## Change Log
